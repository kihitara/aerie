=========================================
=== AERIE DOES NOT WORK IN MOODLE 2.3 ===
=============== OR NEWER ================

If you want a version of Aerie for 2.3
onwards, please download Aerie Lite.
Aerie Lite does NOT have the extra block
areas, but has all other features of
Aerie.

=========================================

Aerie is a fluid-width, three-column theme
for Moodle 2.2, with six extra positions
for blocks (three top and three bottom).
The custom menu contains a Home link which
always appears to the very left, and a My
courses and Login/Logout link, which appears
after any administrator-added items.

Aerie has a settings page that lets you
modify various background colours, custom
footer, custom css, and the site logo.

NB: While the theme is for Moodle 2.2, the
version.php file contains the information
for lowering this requirement. Theme has not
been tested in 2.0 or 2.1, so doing so is
currently at your own risk. My aim is to
have this theme fully compatible with all
versions of Moodle 2.

*************** Installing ***************
If you have downloaded this from Moodle.org,
simply unzip the file and copy the "aerie"
folder to your Moodle theme directory.

If you have downloaded this from github,
unzip the file, rename the
"kihitara-moodle-theme_aerie-NUMBERS"
folder to "aerie", then copy that folder
to your Moodle theme directory.
